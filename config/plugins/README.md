# Plugins

Electron Forge has a plugin system which allows easy extensibility of the core functionality of forge. By default, Forge takes a vanilla JS application and packages, makes and publishes it.

Through the use of plugins, you can make Forge even more powerful. For instance integrating directly with industry standard build tooling like WebPack.

If you want to write your own plugin check out [Writing Plugins](../../advanced/extending-electron-forge/writing-plugins.md).
