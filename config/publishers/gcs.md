# Google Cloud Storage

{% hint style="info" %}
This Publisher was added in Electron Forge **v7.1.0**.
{% endhint %}

The Google Cloud Storage target publishes all your artifacts to a [Google Cloud Storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs).

## Authentication

Under the hood, the Google Cloud Storage Publisher uses the `@google-cloud/storage` SDK and its associated authentication options.

We recommend following [Google's authentication documentation for client libraries](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/client-libraries#node.js) to get authentication configured.

## Usage

To pass options into the Google Cloud Storage SDK's [Storage constructor](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/docs/reference/storage/latest/storage/storageoptions), use the `config.storageOptions` parameter.

{% code title="forge.config.js" %}
```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  publishers: [
    {
      name: '@electron-forge/publisher-gcs',
      config: {
        storageOptions: {
          // add additional Storage constructor parameters here
          projectId: 'my-project-id'
        },
        bucket: 'my-bucket',
        folder: 'custom-folder-name',
        public: true
      }
    }
  ]
};
```
{% endcode %}

When executed, the Publisher will publish to your GCS bucket under the following key:

```
${config.folder || version}/${artifactName}
```

Additional configuration options are documented in [`PublisherGCSConfig`](http://js.electronforge.io/interfaces/\_electron\_forge\_publisher\_gcs.PublisherGCSConfig.html).

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you run publish twice with the same version on the same platform, it is possible for your old artifacts to get overwritten in Storage. It is your responsibility to ensure that you don't overwrite your own releases.
{% endhint %}
