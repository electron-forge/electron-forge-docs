# S3

The S3 target publishes your Make artifacts to an Amazon S3 bucket.

## Authentication

It is recommended to follow the [Amazon AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) and set either a shared credentials guide or the proper environment variables. However, if that is not possible, the publisher config allows the setting of the `accessKeyId` and `secretAccessKey` configuration options.

## Usage

Configuration options are documented in [`PublisherS3Config`](https://js.electronforge.io/interfaces/_electron_forge_publisher_s3.PublisherS3Config.html).

{% code title="forge.config.js" %}

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  publishers: [
    {
      name: "@electron-forge/publisher-s3",
      config: {
        bucket: "my-bucket",
        public: true,
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

{% endcode %}

### Key management

By default, the S3 publisher will upload its objects to the`PREFIX/NAME` key, where:

- `PREFIX` is the value of the `config.folder` option (defaults to your package.json version).
- `NAME` is the file name of the artifact you are publishing.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you run the Publish command multiple times on the same platform for the same version (e.g. simultaneously publishing `ia32` and `x64` Windows artifacts), your uploads can get overwritten in the S3 bucket.

To avoid this problem, you can use the `keyResolver` option to generate the S3 key programmatically.

{% code title="forge.config.js" %}

```javascript
{
  name: '@electron-forge/publisher-s3',
  config: {
    // ...
    keyResolver: (fileName: string, platform: string, arch: string) => {
      return `some-prefix/${platform}/${arch}/filename`;
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

{% endcode %}
{% endhint %}
