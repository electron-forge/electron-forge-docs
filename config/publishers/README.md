# Publishers

Publishers are Electron Forge's way of taking the artifacts generated by the [`make` command](../makers/) and sending them to a service somewhere for you to distribute or [use as updates](../../advanced/auto-update.md). This could be your update server or an S3 bucket.

Each publisher has to be configured in the `publishers` section of your Forge configuration with which platforms to run for and the publisher specific config. For example:

{% code title="forge.config.js" %}
```javascript
module.exports = {
  publishers: [
    {
      name: '@electron-forge/publisher-s3',
      platforms: ['darwin', 'linux'],
      config: {
        bucket: 'my-bucket',
        folder: 'my/key/prefix'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% endcode %}

Please note that all publishers default to publishing all platforms, so you only need to specify the `platforms` key if you don't want that default.
